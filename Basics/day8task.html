            Why doesn't the paragraph tag preserve whitespace as it is?
        </h3>
        <p>Why Do Consecutive Whitespaces Collapse?
            In HTML, multiple spaces, tabs, and line breaks are treated as a single space. 
            This is designed to standardize the rendering of content across different browsers.
            Default CSS white-space Property:
            The white-space property in most elements is set to "normal" by default, meaning:
            Extra spaces are merged into one.
            Text automatically wraps at the end of a line.

        <h3>How does the function access the event object and the element that triggered it in the following code?
            function handleInput(event){
                setText(event.target.value)
            }
        </h3>
        <p>When the handleInput function is called (e.g., through an input field's onChange handler), the browser passes an event object to the function.
            This event object provides details about the triggered event, such as:
            The type of event (e.g., change, click).
            The target property points to the DOM element that fired the event.
            The value property within event.target represents the current value of the form control that triggered the event.

        <h3>Why does the Link component turn into an anchor tag, and className into class, when inspecting the DOM?</h3>
        <p>The Link component (from libraries like react-router-dom) gets rendered as an anchor tag (<a>) in the DOM through JSX transformations.
            React internally uses JSX to generate actual HTML elements and map attributes like "to" into "href" in the resulting <a> tag.
            
            Regarding the className attribute: React uses "className" in JSX because "class" is a reserved keyword in JavaScript.
            During the rendering process, React modifies "className" to "class" using DOM APIs such as setAttribute() to ensure valid HTML output.
